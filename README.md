Remote coding environments and editors are also fast-rising technologies that aim to boost developer productivity by offering isolated, disposable, and easily configurable development environments. In this course, Fikayo Adepoju shows you how GitHub Codespaces combine the best of both worlds by providing a remote development environment built on the worldâ€™s largest remote repository service.
